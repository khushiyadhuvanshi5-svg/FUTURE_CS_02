Cyber Security Task 2





Phishing Email Detection & Awareness System






🔍 About the Task
Phishing is one of the most common and costly cyber attacks faced by businesses today.

Attackers trick users into:

clicking malicious links
downloading infected files
sharing passwords or OTPs
Most successful phishing attacks happen not because of weak systems, but because users don’t know how to identify fake emails.

🎯 Objective
Your goal is to:

Analyze real phishing email samples
Identify common phishing indicators
Classify email risk clearly
Explain attacks in simple, non-technical language
Create an awareness document that helps users avoid phishing attacks
This is security education + analysis, not hacking.
